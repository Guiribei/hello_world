	Hello World!
</h1>

## Summary
> <i>This small project was created as a light-hearted response to a friend's request for a unique implementation of a 'Hello World' program. The challenge involved creating a 'Hello World' program using a linked list, with each node containing a single letter, which is then printed. Essentially, the program functions in two distinct ways. The first mode produces the standard 'Hello World' output. The second mode involves passing arguments to the program, which are then concatenated and printed as a single string.</i>


## Compilation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Guiribei/hello_world.git
```

2. Change to the repository directory:

```bash
cd hello_world
```

3. Compile the project using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
```

## Example Usage

You can either run the program with or without any arguments. If you do pass any argument they will be concatenated and printed as a single string.


```bash
./hello
```
The output will be: <br> <hr>
$ Hello World! <br> <hr>

Or you can use arguments:

```bash
./hello some arguments
```

The output will be: <br> <hr>
$ some arguments <br> <hr>
